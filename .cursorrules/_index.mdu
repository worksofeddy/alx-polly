Project: alx-polly (Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind + Supabase)

High-priority rules
- Prefer server components; mark client ones with "use client" only when needed (hooks/DOM APIs).
- Keep shared UI in `components/ui/`, auth UI in `src/components/auth/`, contexts in `src/contexts/`, Supabase client in `lib/supabase/`.
- Use explicit types on exported APIs; avoid `any`.
- Match existing ESLint/Prettier formatting and indentation; avoid unrelated refactors.
- Early returns over deep nesting; handle errors explicitly.
- Do not commit secrets; only use `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` locally and in deploy env.
- Prefer server actions for DB mutations when possible.
- Ensure accessibility: labels, focus states, keyboard navigation, contrast.

Scope notes
- Polls live under `app/polls/`.
- Auth routes/components live under `app/auth/` and `src/components/auth/`.

PR guidance
- Keep edits minimal and focused. Include a short summary and screenshots for UI changes.
